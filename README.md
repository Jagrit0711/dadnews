## üß† What Is Dad News?

**Dad News** is a playful news delivery platform where *each news article is reviewed and approved manually* in the backend before it reaches readers. Think of it as a fun take on content moderation, where "dad" ensures you only see quality (and often critical!) reads.

We‚Äôre not trying to replace news giants ‚Äî we‚Äôre trying to make you laugh, think, and stay informed without the pressure.

### üîë Highlights:
- üßì **Dad-curated content**: News only shows after dad approves it.
- üí¨ **Random dad messages**: From _"READ IT!"_ to _"Save this one, it's gold."_
- üì± **Mobile-friendly, GenZ UI**: Clean design with zero clutter.
- ‚è≥ **Read at your own pace**: Dad‚Äôs got your back ‚Äî no doomscrolling here.

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

1. **Upload News**  
   A new article (headline, summary, source link) is utomatically added through a new api.

2. **Dad Reviews**  
   The article is hidden by default until approved by the admin (*a.k.a. dad*).

3. **Frontend Displays**  
   Once approved, it shows on the homepage with a random dad message like:
   - `"READ IT LATER ‚Äì trust me!"`
   - `"Dad says: This is critical reading!"`
   - `"Don‚Äôt skip this one, champ."`

4. **Readers Chill & Browse**  
   Readers can browse these fun but insightful news articles without distractions.
